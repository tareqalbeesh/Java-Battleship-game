# Java Battleship Game

## Overview
This is a Java implementation of the classic Battleship game. The game demonstrates the usage of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and multithreading in Java. One notable feature is the implementation of a moving trap using threads during gameplay.

## Features
- Object-oriented design: The game is built using OOP principles, making the codebase modular, scalable, and maintainable.
- Multithreading: The game utilizes threads for concurrent execution, including the implementation of a moving trap that adds an extra layer of challenge to gameplay.
- Interactive gameplay: Players can engage in battleship matches against the computer, attempting to sink the opponent's ships while protecting their own fleet.
- User-friendly interface: The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances the gaming experience with intuitive controls and visual feedback.
- Cheating key: For debugging or testing purposes, the game includes a cheating key that allows players to reveal the enemy's board, providing insights into the opponent's ship placements.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Game directory.
3. run the `Battle ship game.Jar` file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to start a new game, place your ships, and engage in battleship warfare.

## Technologies Used
- Java: The core programming language used for game development.
- Swing: The Java Swing framework is utilized for creating the graphical user interface.
- Threads: Java threads are employed for implementing concurrent behavior, such as the moving trap feature.
